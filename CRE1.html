		<h2>THE BIBLE</h2>
	<p>The word Bible comes from the Greek word Biblia that means a book.
Christians believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God.  By referring to the Bible as a word of God it means:<br>
-The Bible was inspired by God. It contains the words of people such as the prophets who were sent by God.<br>
- The Bible is also believed to be the word of God because it contains predictions and prophecies which eventually came to true.<br>
-God Himself took part in the writing: God wrote the 10 commandments. (Exd.34:1)<br>
-The authors of the Bible wrote under the influence of the Holy Spirit.<br>
-Much of the New Testament is concerned with the Good News of Jesus Christ.<br>
-The Bible contains the true message of God for daily living.  Therefore
 Christians believe that God communicates to us through the Bible.<br>
-Those who wrote were told on what to write by God.<br>

		<h2>THE BIBLE AS A LIBRARY</h2>

		<h2>THE DIVISIONS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
	<p>The Bible has two main sections namely The Old Testament and The New Testament.<br>
        The word Testament means covenant.  The standard Bibles that are
 recommended for all the Christians contain 39 books in The Old 
Testament and 27 books in the New Testament section, making a total of 
66 books.<br>

 The main difference between the Old and the New Testaments is that the 
Old Testament was written before Christ while the New Testament was 
written after Christ.<br>
        However some Bibles, such as the Jerusalem Bible and the African
 Bible mostly used by the Roman Catholic Church contain additional books
 in the Old Testament.  These books include:<br>
1. Judith<br>
2. Ecclesiasticus<br>
3. Baruch<br>
4. Maccabees 1 and 2<br>
5. Wisdom<br>
6. Tobit<br>

These extra-books have been referred to as Deutro-canonical books by the
 Catholics or are referred to as apocryphal books by the Protestants.<br>

	<p></p>
	</div>

	<div id="topic26">
		<h2>THE NEW TESTAMENT BOOKS</h2>
	<p></p><h3>1. The gospels or Biographical Books.</h3>
These are the first four books of the New Testament.  Namely; Mathew, Mark, Luke and John.<br>
	The first three books are called Synoptic gospels because they are 
almost similar in the arrangement of events and style of writing.<br>
	The gospels talk about the events in the life of Jesus, from his birth to death and to ascension to heaven.<br>
	St. Mark was the first to be written about 70 A.D.  Before that, the 
Good News was spread by word of mouth.  This period is referred to as 
the Oral Tradition.<br>

<h3>2. Acts of the Apostles</h3>

	<div id="topic27">
		<h2>HUMAN AUTHORS</h2>
	<p>The human authors were inspired by God.  They wrote what God Himself
 revealed  to them.  This is brought out in 2 Peter: 1:20-21 where he 
says, “Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of the scriptures
 came about by the prophets’ own interpretation, because no prophecy 
ever came by the will of human beings, but it was    spoken from God as 
it were and carried out by the Holy Spirit.”The authors who contributed 
to the writing of the Bible lived over a long time.  They were from 
different walks of life.  They had different ideas, talents and 
purposes.<br>
</p><ul><li>Some compiled oral traditions that had existed for many generations.</li>
<li>Others composed songs or recorded the wise sayings, such as Solomon and David.</li>
<li>Some wrote as scribes for their own teachers.  For example Jeremiah dictated to Baruch what to write.</li>
<li>Others such as Joshua and Esther wrote to record the History of their people and their dealings with God.</li>
<li>While others like Moses were interested in the religious law and regulations.</li><ul>
The different authors used different styles of writing (literary forms).  This was because:<br>
<ol><li> They wrote at different times in history.</li>
<li> They also wrote under different circumstances e.g. in the wilderness, in a dungeon, in prison.</li>
<li> They wrote for different reasons.</li>
<li> The audience was also different.</li></ol>

<h5>Some of the styles or literacy forms used in the Bible are:</h5>
<ol><li> Poetic (poems) – Books of Psalms.</li>
<li> Wise sayings – The Book of Proverbs.</li>
<li> Prose, narratives or stories- Genesis, Exodus, Numbers.</li>
<li> Prayers – The Book of Nehemiah.</li>
<li> Legal expressions – the book of Leviticus.</li>
<li> Prophecies – The Books of prophet the Prophets.</li>
<li> Letters – Paul’s letters.</li>
<li> Songs – Songs of Solomon.</li></ol><br>

Despite the fact that the language and style of writing may differ from 
one author to another, all those who wrote had a similar purpose, i.e. 
to reveal God’s word to His people.  This means that the authors’ work 
is in total agreement. No work of any author contradicts the work of 
another.<br>

		<h2>THE BIBLE TRANSLATION</h2>
	<p>The term “translate” means to change something from one language to another without changing the original meaning.<br>
The Old Testament section of the Bible originally was written in Hebrew,
 which was the language of the Israelites in Palestine (Jews).  And the 
New Testament was written in Greek.<br>
However before long the Old Testament also had to be translated in Greek.<br>  This was because:<br>
</p><ol><li> Greek was the most commonly used language outside Palestine.</li>
<li>   There were also Jews who were living outside Palestine and they knew Greek Language better than Hebrew.</li>
<li> The number of people who wanted to read the scriptures was also growing.</li></ol>

The Greek translation of the Old Testament was called the Septuagint.  
The Jews who were living outside Palestine were called the Jews in the 
Diaspora or in dispersions.<br>
During the 4th C A.D, a Christian called Jerome translated the Bible 
into Latin.  This Bible translated into Latin was called the Vulgate.
When the missionaries came to Africa, the Bible was translated into 
several local languages.<br>
This was because<br>
<ol type="i"><li> To make the missionaries evangelize effectively.</li>
<li> The missionaries wanted to put the word of God into a language, which the local people would understand easily.</li>
<li> To assist the missionaries to learn local languages.</li>
<li> To revise all the versions and keep a breast of changes</li> in the world.
<li> To indigenize Christianity i.e. to encourage its adaptation to local situations.</li></ol>
In East Africa the first Bible translations was done by John Ludwig Kraft.<br>
  It took him nine years to have the New Testament translated into 
Kiswahili. He also translated the gospel of Mark into Kikamba and the 
gospel of Luke into Kirabai.<br>
The work of translating the Bible is still going on.  In Kenya this is done by the Bible society of Kenya.<br>
There are several versions used in Kenya.  These include:-<br> <ol><li>Revised Standard Version.</li>
<li> King James Version.</li>
<li> New international version.</li>
<li> Jerusalem Bible.</li>
<li> The living Bible.</li>
<li> Jerome Bible.</li>
<li> Gideon international Bible.</li>
<li> English Bible.</li>
<li> New American Bible.</li>
<li> Authorized Version.</li>
<li> Good News.</li>
<li> The Holy Bible.</li>
<li> New African Bible.</li></ol>

		<h2>Effects of translation of the Bible</h2>
	<p><ul><li>The translation of the Bible promoted education in Kenya.  The Bible was used as the first textbook. <li> The missionaries started schools.
More people became Christians because they had the Bible in their own languages.</li>
<li>The translation helped the missionaries to learn local languages.</li>
<li>The missionaries were able to easily and effectively preach to the people in a language they could understand.</li>
<li>The Africans were able to have a clear understanding of the Holy Scriptures.  This increased their faith.</li>
<li>The Africans broke away to form independent churches
 <li> The discovered that what the Bible preaches on equality of all mankind was not practiced by the missionaries.</li>
<li>The translation of the Bible led to the establishment of Bible translation societies, for example the translation of the Bible in Kenya is done by the Bible society of Kenya.</li>
<li>The missionaries began to appreciate the African culture and this reduced suspicion between the two parties.</li>
<li>The translation led to Geographical expansion of the Church into new areas. </li></ul><br>

		<h2>CREATION AND FALL OF MAN</h2>
	<p><h3>THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNTS OF CREATION</h3>
Biblical term, creation refers to how God made the universe and everything in it.<br>
The biblical accounts of creation are attempts to answer basic questions about life e.g. how did life come about? Or why do people die?<br>
The Bible contains two accounts of creation at the beginning of the book of Genesis.  The first account is found in Genesis 1:1-2, 4 (a) and the second account is found in Genesis 2:4(b) -25.<br>
<h4>The first account of creation 
Gen.1-2: 4(a)</h4>
Chapter 1 verses 1 and 2 tell us that God was there before creation.<br>
<ol><li> On the first day God created light and separated it from darkness.  He named it day and darkness night.</li>
<li> On the second day, God created the Firmament: the firmament separated the waters that were above the sky and the waters below the sky.</li>
<li> On the third day God divided the land and the sea then he created all the plants and trees found on the earth.</li>
<li> On the fourth day, God created the three heavenly lights i.e. the sun to give light at daytime while the moon and the star to give light during the night.</li>
<li> On the fifth day, God created the sea living creatures such as fish.  He also made birds of all kinds.</li>
<li> On the sixth day, God created all living creatures on earth.  It is also the sixth day that God created man in His own image and likeness.  The creation of man is very significant for God says “Let us make man in our own image” all work of creation therefore was completed on the sixth day.</li>
<li> On the seventh day God rested and blessed it as a special day of worship.</li></ol>
<h4>The second account of creation
(Genesis 2:4(b) – 25)</h4>
<ul><li>The second account is centered on the creation of man and woman.</li>
<li>It gives a detailed account of how God created Adam out of dust and breathed into him the breath of life.  In the same account the creation of woman is brought out more clearly:  The woman is made from the ribs of the man.</li>
<li>In the second account God’s creative activities is seen as work and not utterances.</li>
<li>For example man is made out of dust and woman out of the ribs of man.</li>
<li>In the second story the creation of the Garden of Eden is mentioned.  In the centre of the garden.  God placed the tree of life and the tree of good and evil.</li>
<li>Man is put in the Garden of Eden to take care of God’s creation.  Man is commanded to eat from every tree except one; the tree of the knowledge of Good and evil for in so doing they would die.</li> 
<li>It explains the special position that human kind occupies in God’s creation.</li></ol><br>
<h4>What shows that man is God’s special creation?</h4>
<ul><li>God made man in His image and likeness.</li>

<ul><li>They call their God <em>Were Khakaba</em> meaning the provider.  Were Khakaba created the world alone.</li>
<li>First he created heaven as His dwelling place which was very bright and which was supported on pillars like a hut to stop it from falling.<br>  Then He created His two assistants Mukobe and Murumwa.  Later on He made the moon and the sun; the two quarreled and fought.  Moon was defeated and thrown down into the wind to prevent him from shining brightly.</li>
<li>Were ordered the sun to shine during the day on all people while moon was to shine only at night.</li>
<li>Were then made the clouds and the stars.  He made a big red rock which crows whenever it thunders warning people of the coming rain.</li>

It was also a sign of His splendor and mystery.  After calling Gikuyu, He took him to the top of this mountain and showed him the land he was to give him.</li>
<li>It was beautiful and full of fig trees (Mugumo) in the centre of the country.  God then ordered him to go and establish his homestead at the place he had showed him.  This place was called Mukuruwe wa Nyagathanga that is in Muranga District.</li>
<li>Before Gikuyu parted with God, he was advised to make a sacrifice and raise his hands towards Kirinyaga if he wanted anything or had problems.</li>
<li>When he went to the Promised Land, he found a wife called Mumbi (creator or moulder) that god had provided for him.
<li>They lived happily and were blessed with nine daughters.  Gikuyu was so disturbed by the fact that he did not have sons to inherit his property.</li>
<li>He then remembered what Ngai had told him to do.  He decided to make sacrifice and told God his needs.  God told him to take his family home and come back alone.  On the process God revealed to Gikuyu that he would provide young men would be willing to marry his daughters.</li>

They all agreed to marry them.  All the nine daughters were married and each established their own family set.  These were joined together under the name Nyumba ya Mumbi (The House of Mumbi).</li></ul>
